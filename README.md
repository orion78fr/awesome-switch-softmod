# Awesome Switch Softmod

A collection of Nintendo Switch softmod resources

## [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere)

The main software for the Switch softmod.  
Replace some part of the OS and allows patching others.  
Enables EmuNAND (a safe copy of the system on the SD card to leave no trace on the system itself).

## [sys-ftpd-light](https://github.com/cathery/sys-ftpd-light)

A background ftp server to do transfers on the SD card.

## [Emuiibo](https://github.com/XorTroll/emuiibo)

An amiibo emulator.  
You can create amiibo on your computer, transfer them on the Switch and use them in games using an overlay.

## [MissionControl](https://github.com/ndeadly/MissionControl)

Use non-Switch controllers directly on the switch with Bluetooth without adapters.

## [sys-hidplus](https://github.com/PaskaPinishkes/sys-hidplus)

Control the Switch from a computer.  
You can remote control your Switch using Parsec with this (enabling remote multiplayer).

## [TinWoo](https://github.com/mrdude2478/TinWoo)

A .nsp / .nsz / .xci / .xcz installer.

## [NS-USBLoader](https://github.com/developersu/ns-usbloader)

Use USB or WiFi to transfer files to TinWoo.

## Sigcheck patches

Allows you to launch unsigned software on switch.  
As this allows illegal things, I won't link to it directly, but you can find them on the Temporary Game Boy Advance forums.
