# Awesome Switch Softmod

A collection of Nintendo Switch softmod resources

## Payloads & injectors

### [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere)

The main software for the Switch softmod.  
Replace some part of the OS and allows patching others.  
Enables EmuMMC (a safe copy of the system on the SD card to leave no trace on the system itself).

### [Hekate](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate)

A GUI Bootloader for the Switch.  
You can do a lot of things with this, like enabling AutoRCM, connect the Switch SD or internal storage as mass storage, create EmuMMC partition...

### [TegraRcmGUI](https://github.com/eliboa/TegraRcmGUI)

A Windows GUI for payload injection (for Atmosphere & Hekate).  
Allows auto-inject payload on Switch connection.

### Sigcheck patches

Allows you to launch unsigned software on switch.  
As this allows illegal things, I won't link to it directly, but you can find them on the "Temporary Game Boy Advance" forums.
